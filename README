Simple script to backup small mysql databases and keep a number of older backups until the backup count is reached and then they are deleted and replaced.

* Only tested with a 15MB database and it works quite well, haven't tried bigger databases *

The highest folder number is the latest backup, the lowest is the oldest.

Backup Count: is the ammount of backups you want to keep.
Path: is where the backups will be stored.

ex: if the backup count is set to 3, you can have 3 copies stored.

Backup 1: 15/05/2011 (date of backup)
Backup 2: 16/05/2011
Backup 3: 17/05/2011


When another backup is run:

Backup 1: 15/05/2011 <-- will be deleted

All the other backups are moved one step backwards:

Backup 1: 16/05/2011 
Backup 2: 17/05/2011 
Backup 3: 18/05/2011 <-- this will always be the latest backup


** The backup folder is renamed to {name of folder}.locked to overcome concurrent requests to the script messing up the file structure.
If there are concurrent the script will fulfill the first request and the other one will exit out.
