Simple script to backup small mysql databases and keep a version

* Have only tested script with a 15MB database (works fine) *

Idea is to have a cron job running the backup.php script whenever you set it to and
according to how many backups you wish to keep it will delete the old backup and create a new one.

The highest folder number is the latest backup, the lowest is the oldest.
